Social Media User Behavior Analysis
**Overview**
This project explores social media user behavior by analyzing their engagement levels, content preferences, and resultant actions. The goal is to segment users based on their interaction patterns to enhance content delivery and optimize marketing strategies. Using clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, the project builds user segments to improve recommendation accuracy and targeting of marketing campaigns.

**Project Objective**
1. Analyze user behavior on social media platforms by studying engagement levels and content selection.
2. Apply data analytics to derive actionable insights for optimizing content delivery.
3. Use clustering techniques (K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering) to identify behavioral user segments.
4. Evaluate clustering models based on their accuracy, robustness, and scalability.

**Steps Involved**
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather and clean data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify patterns and relationships.
3. Clustering Implementation: Apply K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering techniques to segment users.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the clustering models for accuracy, scalability, and robustness.

**Findings: 
Provide recommendations to improve social media engagement strategies based on the user segments identified.**

**Technologies Used:
1. Python for data analysis and clustering
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering**

**Expected Outcomes:
1. Insights into user behavior patterns on social media.
2. Identification of key user segments for targeted content and marketing.
3. Improved social media engagement and recommendation strategies.**
